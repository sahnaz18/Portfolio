Code Explanation
I start by importing the necessary libraries, including numpy for numerical operations and matplotlib for plotting.

Next, I create sample data for the agronomic system. I define the years from 2010 to 2015 and the corresponding crop yield values in tons per hectare.

I then plot the crop yield data over the years using matplotlib.pyplot. The plot displays the trend of crop yield over time, making it easier to visualize and analyze the data.

The resulting visualization can be used in QGIS or remote sensing software to further analyze the agronomic system's performance and make informed decisions based on the data.

This code snippet provides a basic example of how agronomic data can be visualized in Python, serving as a foundation for more advanced ecosystem modeling and environmental research projects.
